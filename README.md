# OptimizeCode

The following amendments can be implemented to improve the code that you have shared for the test:

1. Add error handling with try-catch blocks for fetching student details, additional school data, and additional legal guardian data.
2. Utilize Promise.all to fetch additional school data and additional legal guardian data concurrently for better performance.
3. Modify the useEffect hook to fetch additional data only when the studentsData state has changed and has at least one student.
4. Update the setSchoolsData and setLegalGuardiansData state updates to spread the additional data arrays correctly.
5. Add error logging to the console for failed fetch operations.
6. Consolidate the fetching of additional school data and additional legal guardian data using map and Promise.all for improved efficiency.
7. Adjust the code to follow consistent formatting and indentation.


These improvements enhance error handling, optimize concurrent data fetching, and provide a more robust and efficient implementation overall.
